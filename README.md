# Enhancing multivariate time-series anomaly detection with positional encoding mechanisms in transformers

This repository contains our newly published article.

In this study, we compared the performance of three well-known positional encoding mechanisms in transformer neural networks for multivariate time-series anomaly detection problems. Additionally, we introduced a novel concept as a state-of-the-art model and compared its results with those of state-of-the-art non-transformer deep learning models.
