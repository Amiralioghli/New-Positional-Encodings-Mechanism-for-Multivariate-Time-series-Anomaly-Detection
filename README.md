# Enhancing multivariate time-series anomaly detection with positional encoding mechanisms in transformers

This repository contains our new published articles

in this article we compared the performance of three well-known positional encoding mechanism of transformer neural networks on multivariate time-series anomaly detection problems and present a new concept as state of the art model and compared the result with sota non-transformer deep learning models.
